\title{Select rasters for specific region with intelligent filtering}
\usage{
select_rasters_for_region(
  input_folder,
  region_boundary,
  overlap = TRUE,
  buffer_size = 0.1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_folder}{Directory containing raster files}

\item{region_boundary}{Region boundary or bounding box}

\item{overlap}{Logical. If TRUE (default), checks for actual overlap with region.
If FALSE, only includes tiles whose centroid falls within region.
Only applies to ASTER files; non-ASTER files always use overlap detection.}

\item{buffer_size}{Buffer around region (in degrees)}
}
\value{
Character vector of relevant file paths
}
\description{
Intelligently select raster files that overlap with a specified region.
For ASTER files (GDEM and WBD), uses filename-based coordinate extraction
for fast filtering without loading full rasters.
}
\examples{
\donttest{
# Select ASTER files for Michigan using overlap detection
michigan_files <- select_rasters_for_region("/aster/files", "Michigan")

# Use centroid-based selection (faster, fewer tiles)
michigan_files_centroid <- select_rasters_for_region("/aster/files", "Michigan", 
                                                      overlap = FALSE)

# Select with custom buffer
nevada_files <- select_rasters_for_region("/data", "Nevada", buffer_size = 0.2)
}
